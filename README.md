## MAXREFDES99 Arduino Library
MAX7219 LED Display Driver Shield

Maxim’s MAXREFDES99# is an Arduino form factor shield which drives a 16 x 16 LED array for signage applications.  This design is ideal for anyone developing display application.  The board features Maxim’s MAX7219, a legendary LED driver which simplifies the process of controlling multiple LEDs in matrix or numeric display form.  In MAXREFDES99#, four MAX7219 ICs are daisy chained to drive a full 256 LED array which may display any international alpha numeric symbol.  The board arrives complete, with four 8x8 LED displays.
Code for the MAXREFDES99# is available on both Arduino and mbed.org platforms for quick prototyping with multiple platform boards.  System demonstrations include the display of ASCII characters ‘SPACE’ through ‘~’ and writing/scrolling string messages.  Developers are encouraged to build upon and enhance the code base.
